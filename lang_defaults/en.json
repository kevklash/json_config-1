It can provide insights regarding the status of the account, aliases, security mechanisms in use, and mailbox usage, including the potential use of third party applications (POP/IMAP). To address sign in issues, you can also remove all recovery information for users who have never been able to sign in, reset sign in cookies for users and unsuspend users.",
